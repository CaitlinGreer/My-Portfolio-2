        <h3>Coming at you live from Orlando, Florida</h3>
        <p>As a new kid in the web developer world I was drawn to the idea of being able to create something from nothing.  I'm fortunate enough to have had a career working face to face with people in a creative industry. Being able to take an idea and make something that exceeds client expectations every time is, what I like to call, my super power. </p>

        <h3>A Little About Myself</h3>
        <p>After working as a hairstylist for most of my life I felt it was time for a change.  So I chose to hang up the shears and pick up the keyboard.  I've always had an interest in code and programming and there's no time like the present for a new career adventure.</p>
     
        <p>Choosing to go back to school at 
          <a href="https://bloc.thinkful.com/" target="_blank">Bloc</a> 
          has been one of the most challenging and rewarding things I've ever done.  We all know that teamwork makes the dreamwork, so I'm looking forward to working on a team with other programmers and truly experiencing everything the industry has to offer. 
        </p>
        <p>If you don't find me at my desk, you'll most likely find me bouncing around Disney World soaking up some Disney magic, spending some quality time with my two dogs or traveling anywhere I possibly can.</p>
        <p>I provide a wide range of services from back end to front end developement, so let's build some things!  Reach out and let's talk about your project!
